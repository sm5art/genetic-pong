# genetic pong game
This project is an application of evolutionary theory to convergence of a solution. This repository contains a game which learns to play pong unsupervised through simulation of evolution.

The AI works like this
1. We have a model that looks like this output (go up down or stay neutral) = tanh(A*inputs)

2. A is the unknown that the genetic algorithm will try to converge to

3. We must represent A in an allele like manner so that crossbreeding and mutations are possible.

4. We start off with initial size n population of randomly generated alleles

5. Run fitness function (how many times can the paddle bounce it without losing) on the population

6. Run a selection process to decide which alleles will breed with which alleles to decide next generation and decide which ones will die.

7. Repeat steps 5-6 until convergence onto A.

# Requirements

1. numpy
2. pygame

# Running the code
To train the bot
~~~
python pong_train.py
~~~

To play against your trained (comes with trained parameters the file is fitted.csv)
~~~
python pong.py
~~~
# TODO
1. COLLECT SOME DATA FOR BLOG POST ON TRAINING
